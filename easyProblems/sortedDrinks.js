// You will be given an array of drinks, with each drink being an object with two properties: name and price. 
// Create a function that has the drinks array as an argument and return the drinks objects sorted by price in ascending order.

let drinks = [
  {name: "lemonade", price: 50},
  {name: "lime", price: 10}
]
// The output of the sorted drinks object will be:

// Examples
// sortDrinkByPrice(drinks) âžž [{name: "lime", price: 10}, {name: "lemonade", price: 50}]
